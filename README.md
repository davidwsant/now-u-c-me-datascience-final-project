## Now You "C" Me Group for DataScience COMP 5360 Spring 2019

I am aware that python notebooks are horrible for collaboration, so new versions will just receive a new title (probably containing the date) to avoid messing things up with git. 

For the initial commit, I have cleaned all of the data for the ARPE-19 cells. 
I will add the jupyter notebook as well as the input and output files to the repository for access by the team. 

### Info about the updates that have been pushed as of April 17, 2019

I have now cleaned up the data for all three datasets of combined RNA-seq and
hMeDIP-seq (ARPE-19 vitamin C, Schwann Cell vitamin C, and Schwann Cell cAMP).
Additionally, I have taken the markdown comments form the ARPE-19 cleaning
notebook and put them into their own separate document
(Info_about_Data_Cleaning.md) so that it can be viewed separately. Each dataset
was explored thoroughlly in the cleaning and quality control, but further
exploration in clustering and then analysis in classification will be added in
the next steps.
