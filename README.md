## Now You "C" Me Group for DataScience COMP 5360 Spring 2019

I am aware that python notebooks are horrible for collaboration, so new versions will just receive a new title (probably containing the date) to avoid messing things up with git. 
For the initial commit, I have cleaned all of the data for the ARPE-19 cells. 
I will add the jupyter notebook as well as the input and output files to the repository for access by the team.
